  - [ ] implement manual positioning of tiles,
  - tiles can have:
    - [x] changable background,
    - [x] glyph that can be positioned and sized,
    - [x] caption, that can be displayed in connection with glyph,
    - [x] 4 corners texts, that can be positioned anywhere, customized,
    - [x] other visual components on them,
    - [x] 4 defined sizes (Small, Regular, Large, ExtraLarge),
    - [x] custom size defined by SizeCustomCols / SizeCustomRows fields, that can be set to Fixed.
